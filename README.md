# Docker in Action Notes
## Part 1. Process isolation and environment-independent computing
### Chapter 1. Welcome to Docker
- Docker takes a logistical approach to solving common software problems and simplifies your experience installing, running, publishing, and removing software.
- It a command-line program, an engine background process, and a set of remote services
- Container abstraction is at the core of its logistical approach
- Working with containers instead software creates a consistent interface and enables the development of more sophisticated tools
- Containers help keep your computers tidy because software inside containers can't interact with anything outside those containers, and no shared dependencies can be formed
- Docker doesn't provide container technology; it hides the complexity of working directly with the container software and turns best practices into reasonable defaults
- Docker works with the greater container ecosystem; that ecosystem is rich with tooling that solves new and higher-level problems
- `docker help` to get a description of all the docker commands
